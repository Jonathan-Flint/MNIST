    "# MNIST\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNIST dataset is a dataset of written numbers stored in 28x28 pixel greyscale images and is commonly used as a training dataset for neural networks and is frequently used as an introductory learning tool for Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is precisely such a use of the MNIST dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as a self taught introduction to ML, this project is also to serve as further development of my python skills and will be the first time using Git source control\n",
    "The end goal is to have a fully functioning ML model built from scratch to demostrate my proficiency in writing code in python, using Git as a source control tool but most importantly show my mathematical capability to understand and impliment complex machine learning algorithms \n",
    "\n",
    "My starting point is a masters (integrated, 4 year) degree in particle physics and cosmology, in which I learned linear algebra for use in tensor calculus in areas such as Quantum Field Theory. During my degree I also learning basic python programming as an important tool for any experimental phycicist to be able to analyse data. Now, with experience in a role as a data analyst I am looking to expand my skills set and learn the basics of data engineering and data science with the hope to steer my career into one of those fields."
