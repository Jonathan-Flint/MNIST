# MNIST

# The MNIST dataset is a dataset of written numbers stored in 28x28 pixel greyscale images and is commonly used as a training dataset for neural networks and is frequently used as 
# an introductory learning tool for Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)

# This project is precisely such a use of the MNIST dataset

# As well as a self taught introduction to ML, this project is also to serve as further development of my python skills and will be the first time using Git source control
# The end goal is to have a fully functioning ML model built from scratch to demostrate my proficiency in writing code in python, using Git as a source control tool
# but most importantly show my mathematical capability to understand and impliment complex machine learning algorithms 

# My starting point is a masters (integrated, 4 year) degree in particle physics and cosmology, in which I learned linear algebra for use in tensor calculus in areas
# such as Quantum Field Theory. During my degree I also learning basic python programming as an important tool for any experimental phycicist to be able to analyse
# data.
